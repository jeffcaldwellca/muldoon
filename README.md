# Muldoon

**The Multi Domain Name Mapper**

Point any extra domain or subdomain at a WordPress page, post, or archive without redirects. The mapped domain always stays in the visitor's address bar.

## What it does

Point any extra domain or subdomain at a specific WordPress path and the plugin handles the rest transparently. Visitors see the mapped domain in their address bar; WordPress serves content normally from the underlying path. All internal links (navigation, pagination, archives) are rewritten to use the mapped domain.

**Example:**

| Visitor accesses | Served from |
|---|---|
| `www.product-a.com/` | `www.mainsite.com/product-a/` |
| `www.product-a.com/faq/` | `www.mainsite.com/product-a/faq/` |

## Requirements

- WordPress 4.5+
- PHP 7.4+ recommended
- **DNS:** each additional domain's A-record must point to the same IP as your main domain
- **Hosting:** each additional domain must be routed to the same WordPress root directory (virtual host / domain alias / parked domain)

> **Test before configuring:** place a `test.txt` file in your WordPress root and confirm it is reachable from both `yourmain.com/test.txt` and `youraddon.com/test.txt` without redirects. Only proceed once this passes.

---

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate through the WordPress Plugins menu.
3. Navigate to **Tools → Muldoon**.
4. Enter the additional domain in the left field and the WordPress path in the right field.
5. Save.

> **nginx users:** change the PHP Server-Variable setting to `HTTP_HOST` in the Settings tab.

## Features

### Core mapping
- Domain-stays-in-bar mapping, with no redirect and no iframe
- Rewrites all standard WordPress permalink functions (pages, posts, CPTs, archives, categories, feeds, nav menus)
- Keeps the home link and search-form action on the mapped domain while a visitor is browsing it (filterable via `muldoon_filter_rewrite_home_url`)
- Handles `http`/`https` and `www`/`non-www` automatically, so one entry per domain is sufficient
- Multiple mappings supported; all descendant URIs are mapped automatically
- Core, Yoast SEO, and RankMath XML sitemap compatibility
- Elementor preview URL compatibility

### Per-mapping options (advanced panel)
| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| **Active / Inactive toggle** | Disable a mapping without deleting it |
| **301 redirect** | Sends visitors arriving at the original path to the mapped domain |
| **Noindex on original path** | Injects `<meta name="robots" content="noindex,follow">` on the original WordPress path so search engines index only the mapped domain |
| **Pass through unmatched paths** | When a request on the mapped domain doesn't resolve under the mapping's subtree, serves the same path from the main site instead of returning 404. Use when the mapped domain is a branded alias of the main site (e.g. root maps to a landing page, other paths mirror the main site). Off by default; review before enabling on sites with private/unlinked pages, since all public top-level content becomes reachable from the mapped domain. |
| **Site name** | Overrides `bloginfo('name')` / `get_option('blogname')` while visitors are on this mapped domain. Flows through to `<title>` tags, `og:site_name`, RSS feed channel, Yoast `%%sitename%%`, RankMath, etc. Leave empty to inherit the main site's name. |
| **Site tagline** | Overrides `bloginfo('description')` / `get_option('blogdescription')` while on this mapped domain. Used by Yoast `%%sitedesc%%`, RankMath, RSS, and themes that surface the tagline. |
| **Default Open Graph image** | Fallback `og:image` / `twitter:image` URL used when a page on this mapped domain has no per-page share image. Per-page Yoast/RankMath images still take precedence. |
| **Custom `<head>` code** | HTML injected into `wp_head` only when the mapped domain is active (Google Site Verification tags, etc.) |
| **GA4 / GTM ID** | Outputs a `gtag.js` snippet in `wp_head` only on the mapped domain. Accepts `G-XXXXXXXXXX` or `GTM-XXXXXXX` format |
| **robots.txt sitemap URL** | Replaces the `Sitemap:` directive in `robots.txt` when the mapped domain is active |
| **Test connection** | Performs a live HTTP check and displays the response code |

### SEO
- **Canonical tag**: a single `<link rel="canonical">` using the mapped domain on every mapped page. When Yoast SEO or RankMath is active, their canonical is rewritten instead (no duplicate tag); otherwise core's `rel_canonical` is replaced with one mapped-domain tag.
- **Open Graph URL replacement**: patches `og:url` for Yoast SEO and RankMath
- **XML sitemaps**: mapped-domain URLs in the core WordPress sitemap (`wp-sitemap.xml`), Yoast, and RankMath sitemaps
- **REST API domain replacement**: rewrites domain references in REST API JSON responses

### Administration
- **Admin bar badge**: shows the active mapped domain when browsing the frontend while logged in
- **Export Mappings**: downloads all mappings as a JSON file
- **Import Mappings**: uploads a previously exported JSON file and merges it with existing mappings through the sanitizer, reporting how many were added vs. skipped (duplicate/invalid)
- **Drag-to-reorder**: drag mapping rows to set a custom sort order
- **Cache flush**: automatically purges WP Super Cache, W3 Total Cache, WP Rocket, LiteSpeed Cache, WP Engine, and the object cache when mappings or settings change

### Settings tab options
| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **PHP Server-Variable** | `SERVER_NAME` (default) or `HTTP_HOST` (recommended for nginx) |
| **Enhanced compatibility mode** | Disables URI replacement inside `wp-admin` to resolve page-builder conflicts |
| **Excluded domains** | One domain per line; requests from these domains are not processed (useful for WPML / Polylang language domains) |

## Developer hooks

All action hooks are prefixed `muldoon_action_` and all filter hooks are prefixed `muldoon_filter_`. Search for those prefixes in the plugin source to see every available hook.

Key hooks:

| Hook | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `muldoon_filter_uri_match` | filter | Override or extend the URI matching logic |
| `muldoon_filter_request_uri` | filter | Modify the rewritten `REQUEST_URI` |
| `muldoon_filter_filtered_uri` | filter | Modify a replaced URI before it is returned |
| `muldoon_filter_rewrite_home_url` | filter | Return `false` to stop rewriting `home_url()` to the mapped domain |
| `muldoon_filter_save_mapping` | filter | Modify a single mapping before it is saved |
| `muldoon_filter_save_mappings` | filter | Modify the full mappings array before it is saved |
| `muldoon_filter_save_settings` | filter | Modify the settings array before it is saved |
| `muldoon_filter_mapping_sort` | filter | Change the default sort key (`domain`) |
| `muldoon_filter_mapping_class` | filter | Add CSS classes to mapping article elements |
| `muldoon_action_settings_tab` | action | Add content to the Settings tab |
| `muldoon_action_after_mapping_body` | action | Add fields to each mapping's advanced panel |

## Frequently asked questions

**Does it work with caching plugins?**
WP Fastest Cache works out of the box. W3 Total Cache requires enabling "Cache alias hostnames" in Page Cache settings (leave "Additional home URLs" empty). CSS/JS minification in W3TC works on the main domain only. The plugin automatically flushes supported caches when mappings change.

**Does it work with page builders?**
Yes, including Elementor. If a page builder fails to load mapped pages in the editor, enable Enhanced Compatibility Mode in the Settings tab.

**Does it work with Yoast SEO?**
Yes. XML sitemaps list the mapped domains, `og:url` is patched, and the canonical is rewritten to the mapped domain (no duplicate tag).

**Does it work with RankMath?**
Yes. XML sitemaps list the mapped domains, `og:url` is patched, and the canonical is rewritten to the mapped domain.

**What about the default WordPress sitemap?**
The core `wp-sitemap.xml` entries that fall under a mapped path are rewritten to the mapped domain too.

**What about SEO / duplicate content?**
Enable the "Noindex on original path" option per mapping, or enable the "301 redirect" option. The plugin also automatically outputs a canonical tag on mapped pages.

**Does it support international domain names (IDN)?**
Yes, but use punycode format. For example, `www.küche.at` should be entered as `www.xn--kche-0ra.at`.

**Does it support HTTPS?**
Yes. All domains must share the same SSL setup.

**Is it compatible with WooCommerce?**
Not reliably. WooCommerce uses many non-standard link-generation functions that cannot be intercepted consistently.

**Is it compatible with WPML / Polylang?**
Partially. If those plugins manage domains of their own, add them to the Excluded Domains list in the Settings tab to prevent conflicts.

**Is it compatible with WordPress Multisite?**
No. Multisite has built-in domain mapping. This plugin targets single-site installations only.
